in routes, resources vs reource, how to deciside

  resources :users, only: [:new, :create]

  resource :session, only: [:new, :create, :destroy]
    # online have one row of data for session, thus one resource
    ##user only has one session. Rails also provides us with a resource method we can use declare routes for resources we will access without :ids, that is, resources of which the user will only ever access one, and only one. In our auth pattern, we use a singular resource session because a user only interacts with one session (their own).
      #A visitor to your site implicitly has their own session (it's stored in their browser), so there's no need to create routes for different sessions


In the delete action, do we need to run the following line, and why?
    <input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="<%= form_authenticity_token %>">
